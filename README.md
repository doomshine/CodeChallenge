CodeChallenge
=============
Coding challenge for the Nerdery Job Application Work In Progress!

Given a PSD, my challenege was to re-create a static webpage that could be easily dropped in to a fully functioning website, with fully functioning links and javascript. 

I have extrapolated on a few items not show, such as making sure each link changes color to ensure users what is clickable and what isnt. Link areas are as large as possible to ensure ease of use.

No additional frameworks were utilized, everything is hand-coded and heavily googled.
