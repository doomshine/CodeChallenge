CodeChallenge
=============
Coding challenge for the Nerdery Job Application Work In Progress!

Given a PSD, my challenege was to re-create a static webpage that could be easily dropped in to a fully functioning website, with fully functioning links and javascript.

I have extrapolated on a few items not show, such as making sure each link changes color to ensure users what is clickable and what isnt. Link areas are as large as possible to ensure ease of use.

No additional frameworks (Apart from reset.css to ensure the best layout possible) were used. Everything was hand written and heavily googled.

Having never developed for older web browsers, namely Internet Explorer 7 and 8, I find myself utterly lost without any guidence and tips. All resources I could find online were written several years ago, and given the advent of modern web technologies, I could no longer go further with my design. Hover, Internet Explorer 9 and up, as well as all modern browsers should find no trouble with my page.

This project was an extremely fun puzzle and I look forward to what lies ahead.
